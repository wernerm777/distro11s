DISTRO11S

This is a port of distro11s from Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 14.04
There are some minor changes to the command line parameters
A server prerequisite script is included.

First of all run prepserver.sh as ROOT. Do not use sudo.
The script will build your entire system and compile all architectures.

Have fun.
